# Wang Tiler

![Some examples.](/Doxygen/Images/tilings.png)

The source code for this basic Wang tiling generator, written and maintained by
[Ian Parberry](http://ianparberry.com), is intended to be used by students to
extend and modify while they are learning about Wang tiling. Wang tiling is
a method for tiling the plane using only a small number of tiles, in this case
8 tiles, in such a way that large repeated patterns are minimized. See 
[https://ian-parberry.github.io/wangtiler/](https://ian-parberry.github.io/wangtiler/)
for more information.
